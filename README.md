# Hello, I'm Glynn! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me ðŸš€
I'm a Senior Solutions Engineer who has worked in eCommerce for nearly a decade. At the moment, I'm taking a sabbatical from coding and slinging software so I can learn Spanish full-time and achieve my goal of Spanish fluency (or as close as I can get) by the end of 2024!

## My Work ðŸ’»
- ðŸ”­ My chief focus as far as technology goes is in NextJS and utilizing AI services to build more powerful developer tools.
- ðŸŒ± NextJS, AI tools, Spanish, Neuroscience, Basketball!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on lightweight AI side projects.
